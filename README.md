- üìä **Table Support**: Converts Word tables to HTML tables
- üé® **Style Preservation**: Preserves text alignment and basic styling
- üìù **Progress Tracking**: Shows conversion progress and summary

## Requirements

- macOS (or other Unix-like system)
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip3

## Installation (One-time Setup)

**"One-time setup" means you only need to run this ONCE.** After the initial setup, you can use GIACONVERT anytime without running setup again!

1. **Clone or download this project to your Mac**

2. **Run the setup script** (ONLY NEEDED ONCE):
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   This will:
   - Check for Python 3 installation
   - Install required Python packages (only needs to be done once)
   - Make the CLI tool executable

## Usage

### Simple Usage (Recommended)
```bash
./giaconvert /path/to/your/directory
```

### Alternative Usage
```bash
python3 giaconvert.py /path/to/your/directory
```

### Examples

Convert all Word documents in your Documents folder:
```bash
./giaconvert ~/Documents
```

Convert documents in a specific project folder:
```bash
./giaconvert ~/Projects/MyProject
```

Show detailed output during conversion (**verbose** means "show more details"):
```bash
./giaconvert ~/Documents --verbose
```

**What is verbose output?** When you use `--verbose`, GIACONVERT shows you:
- More detailed progress information
- Exactly which files are being processed
- More detailed error messages if something goes wrong
- Additional debugging information

Without `--verbose`, you only see the essential information. With `--verbose`, you see everything that's happening behind the scenes.

### Making it globally available (Optional)

To use the tool from anywhere on your Mac:

1. **Add to your PATH**:
   ```bash
   # Add this line to your ~/.zshrc file
   export PATH="$PATH:/Users/$(whoami)/Documents/Tools/GIAutoConvert"
   ```

2. **Reload your shell**:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

3. **Create a symlink** (alternative method):
   ```bash
   ln -s /Users/$(whoami)/Documents/Tools/GIAutoConvert/giaconvert /usr/local/bin/giaconvert
   ```
